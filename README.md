# Project-Dark-Sky

Welcome to the official development log of Project Dark Sky. 

GAME SUMMARY

Project Dark Sky is an immersive tactical survival shooter set in a crumbling metropolis. 

You are a REAPER, an elite operative from the most lethal fighting force on the planet: [REDACTED].

Your mission:
Reconnaissance across the zone.
Elimination of high-value targets.
Acquisition of irreplaceable assets.
Prevention of further decay.
Extraction of all mission objectives.
Recovery of the Unit.

Project Dark Sky demands tactical decision-making, resource management, and raw skill. One wrong move can cost you everything.

You won't be looting shiny gold weapons off glowing corpses.
You'll be crawling through half-collapsed buildings, scavenging for dirty rounds of ammunition, and praying your suppressor wasn't damaged in that last tumble.

There is no loot score.
You build your skills.
You earn survival.
